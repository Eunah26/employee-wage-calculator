# 🧾 Employee Wage GUI – Java Starter Project (With File Writing)

A beginner-friendly Java Swing project to calculate employee wages and save the results to a file. Designed without OOP to help new learners understand basic GUI and file handling in Java.

---

## 📌 Project Description

This app allows users to:

* Enter employee details (name, hours worked, hourly rate)
* Calculate total wage
* Save each entry to a text file (`wages.txt`) in append mode
* See confirmation after saving

It uses **Java Swing** for the GUI and basic **file I/O** for data persistence.

---

## 🎯 Key Features

* Simple GUI with input fields:

  * Employee Name
  * Hours Worked
  * Hourly Rate
* "Calculate & Save" button:

  * Computes total wage
  * Appends data to `wages.txt`
  * Clears input fields afterward

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

* Java SE (JDK 8+)
* Java Swing
* FileWriter & BufferedWriter
* IDE: NetBeans (or IntelliJ, Eclipse)

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User fills in employee details
2. On clicking **Calculate & Save**:

   * Wage is calculated:
     `wage = hoursWorked * hourlyRate`
   * Entry is saved to `wages.txt`:

     ```
     Name: Alice | Hours: 40 | Rate: 12.5 | Total Wage: 500.0
     ```
   * Input fields are cleared

---

## 📚 Learning Objectives

* Build basic Java GUIs with Swing
* Handle and validate user input
* Perform file writing in append mode
* Focus on logic without OOP complexity

---

## 🔄 Possible Extensions

* Add input validation (e.g., numbers only)
* Add "View Saved Wages" feature
* Sort entries by wage
* Add timestamp to each entry
